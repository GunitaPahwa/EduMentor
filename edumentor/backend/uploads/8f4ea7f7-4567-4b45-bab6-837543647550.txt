        Introduction to Machine Learning
        
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
        
        Key Concepts:
        1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled data
        2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
        3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through interaction with environment
        
        Applications:
        - Image recognition
        - Natural language processing
        - Recommendation systems
        - Autonomous vehicles
        
        Popular Algorithms:
        - Linear Regression
        - Decision Trees
        - Neural Networks
        - Support Vector Machines
